A blog at the convex hull of ML, Physics, and Bayesian Inference.

Hi - I'm Anoop. 

I'm an AI researcher at [Unlearn.ai](https://www.unlearn.ai/) with a background in Physics. I'm broadly interested in Bayesian Inference, Statistical Physics, and Interpretability. This site is a collection of technical notes and essays on topics that interest me. I hope they interest you too!
