My name is Anoop Praturu, I’m a AI researcher at [Unlearn.ai](https://www.unlearn.ai/) interested in Bayesian Inference, Statistical Physics, and Interpretability. I got my PhD in Physics from UCSD under the supervision of [Tatyana Sharpee](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/tatyana-sharpee/), where I used techniques from differential geometry and statistical mechanics to study problems in neuroscience and biophysics. Before that I was a Data Scientist at [Invoca](https://www.invoca.com/?r=0) where I researched non-parametric Bayesian models and MCMC theory for NLP. I got my B.S. in Physics at UCSB in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/).

This site is a collection of technical notes and essays on topics that interest me. The title of this blog is from a footnote in Schrödinger's paper "Quantization as a Boundary Value Problem". If you have any thoughts on my writing, feel free to get in touch!
